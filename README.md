This is a project, which tend to using IRL method to get the weights of the reward, and apply them on certain scenarios.  
This is a project of NCC lab, SUSTech.   
Tend to using IRL method to get the weights of the reward, and apply them on certain scenarios. 
The crash condition and recover policy need to be modified accordingly.  
Note: This project is adapted from jangirrishabh / toyCarIRL, https://github.com/jangirrishabh/toyCarIRL  

IMPORTANT NOTICE  
Due to the wrong setting of weights and the crash conditions, as well as the wrong RL method used, more modifications are needed, maybe this week.    
If you have the old version code and have some questions to ask, feel free to email me!
